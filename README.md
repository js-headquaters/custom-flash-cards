# Flash Cards Application

A mobile-friendly Angular application for learning Spanish phrases using flash cards. The application allows users to create, import, and study flash cards with English-Spanish translations.

## Features

- Create individual flash cards with English and Spanish phrases
- Import flash cards from CSV files
- Study mode with spaced repetition
- Example generation using OpenAI API
- Mobile-friendly interface
- Local storage using IndexedDB
- Progress tracking for each flash card

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm (v6 or higher)

   - Click "Show Answer" to see the Spanish translation
   - Click "I Know" if you remembered correctly
   - Click "I Don't Know" if you need more practice
